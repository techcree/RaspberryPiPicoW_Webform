The respaberry Pi Pico W is the WLAN or wireless variant 
of the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and allows an 
IP address to be assigned after logging in to the router, 
under which the website with the form is then displayed. 
You have to enter your WiFi access data in secret.py so that 
a connection can be established. The script is now also suitable 
for further processing the data saved in this way, for example to 
show it on a display. You may have to use thread to run multiple 
processes on the cores of the microcontrollers at the same time.
To do this, the a_thread.py must be adapted 
accordingly. In general, however, caution is 
required when using the thread function!

Everything always without liability and without guarantee!
Feel free to use the code however you like!
